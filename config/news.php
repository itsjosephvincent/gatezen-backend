        Outstandingly, the total reserves of water including water sources from cooperating Partner
        contracts is approximately 3.5 billion liters per year. However, we cannot estimate the exact
        amount, and the volume can vary from year to year. No doubt that this is a highly demanded
        commodity because Water is Life. We simply cannot live without it and there are upcoming
        smarter, futuristic ways of creating, sanitizing and sustaining our water supply on this planet.
        
        The water components are:
        - Natural Mineral Water
        - Artesian water sources
        - Documented, Low to zero COÂ² footprint
        - Energy from Hydro Power Plants
        - Several different tastes
        - A new NANO technology will be tested Q1/Q2-2023
        
        In furthermore expansion, this Company has ownership in other companies where the
        business is the water industry. AQUA H20 is already in the markets, working in India and the
        Middle East for long term contracts. Such as 3, 5 ,7, 10 years renewable 'Long-Term-
        Conditional-Contracts'. Our stance and position in India & China are strong, where we've had
        business activity since 2009.

        Volver Zen is an EXCHANGE. Today, around 10% is used. In January. the rollout of Volver Zen
        content and functional areas will start and most of it will be functional and interactive. All
        deposits and withdrawals are made legally between Global Trading EXIM International PLC
        and the individual Partner/Shareholder. All business becomes PUBLIC. The intention is to list
        the company on one of the marketplaces on SSE.
        
        The company will need significantly more funding to be able to implement the large and most
        profitable EXIM packages.
        
        A proportion of the volumes can go via GATE ZEN and into the markets, but GATE ZEN does
        not become 'huge in a day'. It will take about 3 years to position GATE Zen in an already busy
        market.
        
        Will GATE Zen succeed? Yes, GATE Zen has a number of competitive advantages. Much has
        been said and written about this in the past, however we are reiterating the impotence of this
        opportunity so it's value is solidified, once again.
        
        It is important that you as Partner find time to explore GATE Zen, which is owned by the GATE
        e-Commerce PLC CY. The potential is billions of markets.
        
        It's not that GATE Zen and Volver Zen are dependent on each other. On the contrary.
        Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that it is very good combination, like cogwheel
        meeting another cogwheel in perfect synergy.",
